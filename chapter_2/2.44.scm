; Exercise 2.44.  Define the procedure up-split used by corner-split. It is similar to right-split, except that it switches the roles of below and beside.

(define (right-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
    painter
    (let ((smaller (right-split painter (- n 1))))
      (beside painter (below smaller smaller)))))

(define (up-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
    painter
    (let ((smaller (up-split painter (- n 1))))
      (below painter (beside smaller smaller)))))
